I build gameplay systems, UI architecture, camera pipelines, and real-time technical features in Unity.  
My strongest side is creating **clean modular systems** with production-ready structure and smooth UX flow.

# ✈️ MQ-9 Drone Simulation (Flagship Project)

A real-time UAV simulation showcasing sensor workflows, thermal vision, targeting, mission flow, and map UI.  
This project demonstrates my ability to work with:

- Inertial gimbal camera systems  
- Thermal vision shaders & post-processing  
- Complex HUDs (compass, distance, lock states, zoom logic)  
- Map UI (paths, marks, heading, Paladin artillery units)  
- Ballistic solver & firing sequence  
- Clean modular architecture (Input → Drone → Sensors → HUD → Missions → Map)
